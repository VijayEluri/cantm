I am just trying to get started with topicmap webapps in ontopia.
What I have at the moment is modelled on this blog series[1] and inspection of the omnigator code.
[1] http://www.topicobserver.com/blog/semantic-web/tm/2010/web-application-development-with-ontopia-part-3/

I am also trying out using github to maintain this project.

To make this work, I have added the following at the top of $ONTOPIA/apache-tomcat/common/classes/tm-sources.xml


  <source class="net.ontopia.topicmaps.utils.ltm.LTMPathTopicMapSource">
    <param name="path" value="/Users/chris/projects/cantm/"/>
    <param name="hidden" value="true"/>
    <param name="suffix" value=".ltm"/>
    <param name="duplicateSuppression" value="true"/>
  </source>

and then added a symlink to the project directory /Users/chris/projects/cantm/ to 
$ONTOPIA/apache-tomcat/webapps
